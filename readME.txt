**Background**

This is my class specific DnD project for my homebrew character. As of now, I am a Paladin Subclass Lich and this program will incorportate reg dice rolling, character specific info and damage calculations, as well as the implementation of the DnD4py package which will allow for information look up.

**How to use**
coming soon
